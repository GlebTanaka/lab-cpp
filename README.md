# Lab C++

This folder is my personal lab for learning and experimenting with modern C++.
The goal is to build practical examples step by step, from beginner to advanced concepts.

# Roadmap

## Phase 1 â€“ Foundations (Weeks 1â€“2)

[ ] Basic syntax (hello world, variables, types, operators)
[ ] Control flow (if, switch, loops)
[ ] Functions (parameters, return values, default arguments)
[ ] Input/Output (std::cin, std::cout)
[ ] Strings (std::string vs C-style strings)

* ðŸ“‚ Folder: [basics](basics/)

---

## Phase 2 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (Weeks 3â€“4)

[ ] Classes (constructors, destructors, methods)
[ ] Encapsulation (private/public/protected)
[ ] RAII principle (automatic resource management)
[ ] Inheritance and polymorphism (virtual functions)
[ ] Operator overloading (operator+, operator[])

* ðŸ“‚ Folder: [oop](oop/)

---

## Phase 3 â€“ STL & Templates (Weeks 5â€“6)

[ ] Containers: std::vector, std::map, std::set, std::unordered_map
[ ] Iterators and ranges
[ ] Algorithms: std::sort, std::find, std::accumulate
[ ] Function & class templates
[ ] Lambda expressions

* ðŸ“‚ Folder: [stl](stl/)

---

## Phase 4 â€“ Advanced C++ (Weeks 7â€“8)

[ ] Smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr)
[ ] Move semantics (std::move, rvalue references)
[ ] Exception handling (try/catch/throw)
[ ] File I/O (std::ifstream, std::ofstream)
[ ] Concurrency basics (std::thread, std::async)

* ðŸ“‚ Folder: [advanced](advanced/)

---

## Phase 5 â€“ Modern Features & Projects (Optional, ongoing)

[ ] C++17/20 features (structured bindings, concepts, ranges, coroutines)
[ ] Design patterns in C++
[ ] Small projects (CLI tool, data structure implementations, simple game)

* ðŸ“‚ Folder: [projects](projects/)
